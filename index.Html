          he led a caretaker government, aiming to restore order and hold fair

          pioneering the microcredit movement, which empowers the poor,<br />
          particularly women, by providing small loans without collateral. His
          work in poverty alleviation and social business earned him the Nobel
          Peace Prize in 2006. Yunus remains a prominent <br />
          advocate for using business to address social issues."
